# Token-OS CI/CD

Token-OS is personal software on a local Mac — there is no remote prod. "Deploy"
means **restart the right local services**. CI is a two-tier gate; CD is a
merge-triggered webhook that reaches the Mac over Tailscale.

## Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `push.yml` — *Push Gate (advisory)* | push to non-`main` branches | Tier 1. Job `push-advisory`. ruff format/lint, mypy, chill CodeRabbit — all **non-blocking** annotations. **No pytest** — the regression suite was stripped from the dev path entirely (Emperor CI-policy decree); it lives only on `prod` (`prod-gate.yml`). |
| `pr.yml` — *PR Gate (blocking)* | PR → `main` | Tier 2. Job **`quality`** (the required check). `ruff format --check` + `ruff check` + `mypy` **block**. **pytest does NOT run on this hot path, by policy** — the heavyweight regression suite wastes Actions minutes and pollutes agent attention on every dev PR, so it was removed from dev entirely and reserved for `prod`. Do not re-add it here. |
| `prod-gate.yml` — *Prod Gate (tests)* | PR/push → `prod`, nightly cron, `workflow_dispatch` | Full pytest suite — the **active** prod-branch regression gate (token-api runs parallel `pytest-xdist -n auto --dist loadfile`; cli-tools is forced serial `-n0` on CI — see "Running tests locally") (the `prod` branch now exists, created off the post-#420/#373 stable `main` HEAD). Runs as the merge-to-prod gate (PR → `prod`), post-merge (push → `prod`), nightly (08:00 UTC sweep of `prod`), and on demand. Never runs on PRs into `main`, so it can't block the dev hot path. To make it a *blocking* merge-to-prod gate, branch protection on `prod` must require the `tests` check. |
| `secrets-scan.yml` | push/PR → `main` | Blocks on leaked IPs/secrets (patterns kept in repo secrets). |
| `deploy-prod.yml` — *Deploy (prod)* | push to `main` (merge) | CD. Tailscale ephemeral node → POST `/api/cd/restart` on the Mac (ack-first) → poll `/health` until `git_sha == github.sha`; mismatch after 180s is a deploy alarm/failure. |

### Ruff never-drift

The format-on-save hook (`cli-tools/scripts/post-tool-format.sh`) and the git
`pre-commit` hook both run **`uv run --python 3.11 --group dev ruff`** — the *exact*
lockfile-pinned ruff CI uses (no floating `uvx`). So local edits are byte-identical
to the gate and format drift never reaches CI. `worktree-setup` installs the
pre-commit hook and syncs both projects' dev venvs.

### Ops cockpit bundle refresh

Token-API serves the Vite build at `token-api/ui/ops` directly. PR CI does not
gate on committed bundle freshness. The local deploy path is authoritative:
`token-restart --sync` detects changes under `token-api/web/ops` or
`token-api/ui/ops`, runs `npm ci --no-audit --no-fund && npm run build` from
`token-api/web/ops` while the runtime checkout is unlocked, and aborts before the
Token-API restart if that required refresh fails. Generated runtime dirt confined
to `token-api/ui/ops` is discarded on the next deploy; mixed dirt is preserved via
the dirty-runtime WIP shunt.

### Running tests locally

Both suites default to **parallel** locally via `addopts = "-n auto --dist loadfile"`
in each `pyproject.toml` `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` — a bare `pytest` (or an agent
session that shells out to it) gets the xdist speedup for free, no `-n` flag to remember.

- **token-api** runs parallel everywhere — local *and* CI (the CI commands already pass
  `-n auto --dist loadfile` explicitly; the addopts is a harmless duplicate).
- **cli-tools** runs parallel **locally** but is pinned **serial on CI** via an explicit
  `pytest -n0 …` in `prod-gate.yml` (now the only workflow that runs pytest — the
  contended GH runner is unverified for cli-tools parallel, so CI keeps the proven
  serial behavior).
- To **debug**, disable parallelism with `pytest -n0` (required for `pdb`, `-s`, and
  reliable single-test runs). Removing the `addopts` line reverts that suite to
  serial-default — a local-only knob, independent of branch protection.

## Branch protection (main)

Required status checks: **`quality`** (pr.yml) + **`secrets-scan`**. The advisory
push job is deliberately named `push-advisory` (not `quality`) so the required
check is unambiguous — it also fires on the PR head-branch push and would
otherwise collide by name.

## Branch protection (prod)

Authority model: **dev = CodeRabbit + CD; prod = full regression suite.** The
`prod` branch carries the heavyweight pytest regression that `main` intentionally
skips (`prod-gate.yml`). To make merge-to-prod *blocking*, configure branch
protection on `prod` to require the **`tests`** check (the `prod-gate.yml` job) —
this is a GitHub settings change, outside the repo, and needs admin.

## CD secrets (provisioned OUTSIDE the repo)

- `CD_RESTART_SECRET` — shared bearer; **must match** token-api's launchd-plist env
  of the same name (`~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openclaw.tokenapi.plist`,
  `EnvironmentVariables`). Endpoint is fail-closed. NOTE: editing the plist env
  needs `launchctl bootout`+`bootstrap`, not `kickstart`/`token-restart`.
- `TAILSCALE_IP_MAC` — the Mac's tailnet IP (reused infra secret) = the webhook host.
- `TS_AUTHKEY` — Tailscale auth key for the ephemeral CI node (tagged `tag:ci`); the
  tailnet ACL must allow `tag:ci` → `<Mac>:7777`.

### TODO — migrate `TS_AUTHKEY` → Tailscale OAuth client (by Sep 2026)

`tailscale/github-action` now recommends an **OAuth client** over a raw auth key,
and the `tailscale/github-action` run warns about it. The current raw `TS_AUTHKEY`
**expires September 2026** — use that forced rotation as the moment to switch:

1. Tailscale admin → **Settings → OAuth clients → Generate** with scope
   `devices:write` (or `auth_keys`) and tag `tag:ci`.
2. Add repo secrets `TS_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` + `TS_OAUTH_SECRET`.
3. In `deploy-prod.yml`, replace the `authkey:` input with
   `oauth-client-id:` / `oauth-secret:` + `tags: tag:ci`.
4. Delete the `TS_AUTHKEY` secret. (OAuth clients don't expire like auth keys, so
   this also ends the annual rotation chore.)
